# dotfiles

Having a consistent development environment across machines has become necessary for me lately. This project is the single point-of-reference I use when configuring the tools I use most often.

## /settings

Settings and config files.

- `iTerm`
  - [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) config files, including preferred themes.
- `python`
  - Python project settings.
- `vs-code`
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings.

## /zsh

I create a `$HOME/.zsh` directory for things like custom scripts and aliases.

- `scripts`
  - Custom Bash or Python scripts.

## User dotfiles

Dotfiles located in my `$HOME` directory.
